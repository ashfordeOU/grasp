## Why Grasp?

Ever opened a new codebase and felt completely lost? **Grasp** turns any GitHub repository or local codebase into an interactive architecture map in seconds — no setup, no accounts, no data leaving your machine.

```
Paste URL / Select Files → See Architecture → Make Better Decisions
```

- **No installation** — runs 100% in your browser
- **No data collection** — your code never leaves your machine  
- **No accounts** — paste a URL and go
- **Works offline** — analyze local files without internet

## Features

### 🏛️ **Architecture Diagram**
Layer-by-layer diagram of your entire codebase. Components grouped by architectural layer (Config, Utils, Data, Services, Components, UI, Test) with dependency arrows between them. Pan, zoom, click any block to explore.

### 🕸️ **Interactive Dependency Graph**
Force-directed graph showing how every file connects. Click any node to highlight its dependencies. Drag, zoom, multi-select with Shift+click.

### 💥 **Blast Radius Analysis**
*"If I change this file, what breaks?"* — Select any file and see exactly how many files would be affected, highlighted directly on the graph.

### 👥 **Code Ownership**
Top contributors for any file based on git history, with line-percentage breakdowns. One-click jump to GitHub Blame.

### 🔐 **Security Scanner**
Automatic detection of:
- Hardcoded secrets & API keys
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Dangerous `eval()` usage
- Debug statements left in production

### 🧩 **Pattern Detection**
Automatically identifies Singleton, Factory, Observer/Event patterns, React custom hooks, and anti-patterns (God Objects, high coupling).

### 📊 **Health Score**
Instant A–F grade based on dead code percentage, circular dependencies, coupling metrics, and security issues.

### 🔥 **Activity Heatmap**
Color files by commit frequency to see the hot spots in your codebase.

### 📋 **PR Impact Analysis**
Paste a PR URL to see which files it touches and calculate the blast radius of proposed changes before merging.

### 💻 **Local File Analysis**
- **Privacy First** — your code never leaves your machine
- **Offline Support** — works without internet
- **Drag & Drop** — drag files or folders straight onto the page
- **Recursive scanning** — analyze entire project structures

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Self-Host (30 seconds)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashfordeOU/grasp.git
cd grasp
open index.html
```
No build process. No dependencies. No `npm install`. **It's one HTML file.**

### Option 2: Analyze Local Files
1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Click **📁 Open Folder**
3. Select the folder to analyze
4. Everything processes entirely in your browser

### Option 3: CLI (terminal)
```bash
npm install -g grasp-mcp-server   # Install once
grasp ./my-project                 # Analyse a local folder
grasp facebook/react               # Analyse a GitHub repo
grasp .                            # Analyse current directory
```
Outputs a colour-coded health report and writes `grasp-report.json`.  
Exit code `0` = CI pass, `1` = issues found.

```bash
# One-off with npx
npx --package=grasp-mcp-server grasp .
```

## For LLM Agents & AI Tools — MCP Server

Grasp ships a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** that exposes the full analysis engine as callable tools for Claude Code, Cursor, and any MCP-compatible agent.

```bash
cd mcp && npm install && npm run build
```

Then add to `~/.claude/claude_mcp_settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "grasp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/grasp/mcp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or run without installing:

```bash
npx grasp-mcp-server
```

**16 tools available to agents:**

| Tool | What it answers |
|------|----------------|
| `grasp_analyze` | Full analysis of any repo or local path — run first |
| `grasp_file_deps` | What does this file depend on? |
| `grasp_dependents` | What breaks if I change this file? |
| `grasp_cycles` | Are there circular dependencies? |
| `grasp_architecture` | What layers does this codebase have? |
| `grasp_hotspots` | Which files are riskiest to touch? |
| `grasp_metrics` | Lines, complexity, fan-in/fan-out per file |
| `grasp_find_path` | How does file A connect to file B? |
| `grasp_security` | Any hardcoded secrets or injection risks? |
| `grasp_patterns` | What design patterns are in use? |
| `grasp_sessions` | List active analysis sessions |
| `grasp_diff` | Compare two analysis snapshots — what changed? |
| `grasp_suggest` | Ranked refactoring suggestions from hotspot data |
| `grasp_explain` | Plain-English explanation of any file or function |
| `grasp_watch` | Re-analyse a directory and diff against a previous run |
| `grasp_unused` | Which functions are dead code — defined but never called? |

Works with GitHub repos and local directories. See [`mcp/README.md`](mcp/README.md) for full setup.

## Usage

### Public Repositories
```
Just paste:   facebook/react
Or full URL:  https://github.com/facebook/react
```

### Private Repositories
1. Create a [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with `repo` scope
2. Select **Token** from the auth dropdown and paste it in
3. Analyze your private repos — token stays in memory only

### Shareable Links
After analysis, click 🔗 to copy a link anyone can use to re-run the same analysis.

    SCORE=$(cat grasp-report.json | jq '.ci.score')
    echo "Health score: $SCORE"
    if [ "$PASSED" != "true" ]; then

## Privacy & Security

**Your code stays on your machine.**

**Browser app:**
- Runs 100% in the browser — no server, no proxy
- GitHub API calls go directly from your browser to GitHub
- Your token (if used) lives in `localStorage` only — never sent anywhere except the GitHub API
- No analytics, no tracking, no accounts
- The entire app is [one open-source HTML file](index.html) — audit it yourself

**MCP server:**
- Runs locally as a subprocess — no outbound connections except the GitHub API
- No telemetry, no data collection
- Local directory analysis never leaves your machine — files are read and discarded in memory

**Browser app:** zero dependencies to install. Everything runs from CDNs: React 18, D3.js 7, Babel.

**MCP server:** Node.js 18+, `npm install` inside `mcp/`.
