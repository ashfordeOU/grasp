## Why Grasp?

Ever opened a new codebase and felt completely lost? **Grasp** turns any GitHub or GitLab repository (cloud or self-hosted) or local codebase into an interactive architecture map in seconds — no setup, no accounts, no data leaving your machine.

```
Paste URL / Select Files → See Architecture → Make Better Decisions
```

- **No installation** — runs 100% in your browser
- **No data collection** — your code never leaves your machine  
- **No accounts** — paste a URL and go
- **Works offline** — analyze local files without internet

---

---

## Features

### 🏛️ **Architecture Diagram**
Layer-by-layer diagram of your entire codebase. Components grouped by architectural layer (Config, Utils, Data, Services, Components, UI, Test) with dependency arrows between them. Pan, zoom, click any block to explore.

### 🕸️ **Interactive Dependency Graph**
Force-directed graph showing how every file connects. Click any node to highlight its dependencies. Drag, zoom, multi-select with Shift+click.

### 💥 **Blast Radius Analysis**
*"If I change this file, what breaks?"* — Select any file and see exactly how many files would be affected, highlighted directly on the graph.

### 👥 **Code Ownership**
Top contributors for any file based on git history, with line-percentage breakdowns. One-click jump to GitHub Blame.

### 🔐 **Security Scanner**
Automatic detection of:
- Hardcoded secrets & API keys
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Dangerous `eval()` usage
- Debug statements left in production

### 🧩 **Pattern Detection**
Automatically identifies Singleton, Factory, Observer/Event patterns, React custom hooks, and anti-patterns (God Objects, high coupling).

### 📊 **Health Score**
Instant A–F grade based on dead code percentage, circular dependencies, coupling metrics, and security issues.

### 🔥 **Activity Heatmap**
Color files by commit frequency to see the hot spots in your codebase. Works for both GitHub repos (via API) and **local repos** (via `git log` — no internet required).

### 🔍 **Graph Node Filtering**
Type in the filter bar at the top of the graph to instantly narrow 200+ nodes down to just the files you care about — matching nodes stay visible, their direct connections dim in, everything else fades out. Press `Escape` to clear.

### 🚫 **Custom Ignore Patterns**
Add your own directory exclusions (e.g. `generated/`, `__mocks__/`, `fixtures/`) via the `⋯ → 🚫 Ignore Patterns` menu. Persists across sessions. Built-in defaults (`node_modules`, `dist`, `.git`, etc.) cannot be removed.

### 📋 **PR Impact Analysis**
Paste a PR URL to see which files it touches and calculate the blast radius of proposed changes before merging.

### 📡 **Live Watch Mode**
Run `grasp . --watch` to start a local dev server with **real-time SSE sync**. Every time you save a file, the browser graph reloads automatically — no manual refresh. A `LIVE` badge appears in the top bar while connected.

### ⏮️ **Time-Travel Architecture Scrubber**
Run `grasp . --timeline` to load your last 30 git commits as a scrubber panel. Drag the slider to any commit — nodes that changed in that commit glow yellow on the graph, so you can watch your architecture evolve over time.

### 🏢 **Team Dashboard** (`team-dashboard.html`)
Track health across multiple repos in one view. Add any public (or private, with a token) GitHub repo and see score, grade, files, issues, circular deps, security findings, architectural layers, **commit activity (7d / 30d)**, **CI status (✅/❌/⏳)**, and a **commit velocity sparkline** — all in a live table with bar charts. Token is shared with the main Grasp app so you only set it once. Export the full table as CSV. Open local folders with 📁 Open Folder (File System Access API).

### 🤖 **AI Chat Panel**
Built-in AI assistant that knows your codebase. Ask questions like *"why is auth.ts a hotspot?"* or *"which files are safest to refactor?"* — it answers with direct references to your dependency graph. Supports Anthropic Claude and OpenAI GPT models. API key stays in your browser only.

### 🎨 **19 Themes**
Full theme system with hover picker and click-to-cycle: **Dark** · **Light** · **Matrix** · **Amber Terminal** · **Dracula** · **Nord** · **Tokyo Night** · **Catppuccin** · **Gruvbox** · **Obsidian Gold** · **Midnight Diamond** · **Carbon** · **Noir** · **Synthwave** · **Ocean Depth** · **Forest** · **Sunset** · **High Contrast** · **Solarized Light**. Theme choice persists across sessions and is shared between Grasp and Team Dashboard.

### 🔎 **Duplicate & Similarity Detection**
The **Dup** color mode highlights files with exact or near-duplicate code — bright red = many duplicates, orange = some, yellow = minor. The `grasp_similarity` MCP tool returns ranked duplicate clusters and code-clone groups for targeted refactoring.

### 🏢 **Monorepo & Workspace Support**
Grasp automatically detects sub-packages in monorepos (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `pom.xml`). A **Workspace** sidebar lets you filter the entire visualization to a single package — all graphs, treemaps, and metrics update instantly.

### 🧰 **Refactor Wizard**
The **Refactor** hints panel (click any file in the graph) shows a prioritized, step-by-step refactor plan for that file — based on fan-in, complexity, duplicate count, layer violations, and churn. The `grasp_refactor` MCP tool generates the same plan as structured output for agents.

### 🔗 **Shareable Embeds**
Click `⋯ → 🔗 Embed` for a modal with a ready-to-paste `<iframe>`, README badge (`![Health](…)`), React component snippet, and a direct link — for sharing live health reports in docs, wikis, or dashboards.

### 💻 **Local File Analysis**
- **Privacy First** — your code never leaves your machine
- **Offline Support** — works without internet
- **Drag & Drop** — drag files or folders straight onto the page
- **Recursive scanning** — analyze entire project structures

## Quick Start

### IDE Extensions

| IDE | Install |
|-----|---------|
| **VS Code** | [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ashfordeOU.grasp-vscode) or `ext install ashfordeOU.grasp-vscode` |
| **JetBrains** (IntelliJ, WebStorm, PyCharm…) | [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/31362-grasp--code-architecture-visualizer) — search **Grasp** in Settings → Plugins |

Both extensions require the free CLI: `npm install -g grasp-mcp-server`

> **Manual installs:** Every release ships a signed `.zip` (JetBrains) and `.vsix` (VS Code) on the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/ashfordeOU/grasp/releases) — useful for air-gapped or enterprise environments.

### Browser Extensions

| Browser | Install |
|---------|---------|
| **Chrome** | [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/grasp-code-architecture) — or install `.zip` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ashfordeOU/grasp/releases) |
| **Firefox** | [Firefox Add-ons (AMO)](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/grasp-code-architecture) — or install `.xpi` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ashfordeOU/grasp/releases) |
| **Safari** | Download `.zip` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ashfordeOU/grasp/releases) — see sideload instructions below (macOS 13+) |

All three extensions add a floating **Grasp** button on any GitHub or GitLab repo page. Click it to open the dependency graph. Custom Git hosts (self-hosted GitLab, GitHub Enterprise) are supported — the popup detects the hostname and offers a one-click permission grant.

#### 🧭 Safari Sideload Instructions

```bash
curl -sL https://github.com/ashfordeOU/grasp/releases/latest/download/grasp-safari-extension.zip -o /tmp/grasp-safari.zip && unzip -q /tmp/grasp-safari.zip -d /tmp/grasp-safari && mv /tmp/grasp-safari/Grasp.app /Applications/ && open /Applications/Grasp.app
```

Then in Safari: **Settings → Extensions → enable Grasp**. If it doesn't appear, first enable **Safari → Develop → Allow Unsigned Extensions** (turn on the Develop menu under Safari Settings → Advanced).

### Option 1: Self-Host (30 seconds)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashfordeOU/grasp.git
cd grasp
open index.html           # Main app
open team-dashboard.html  # Team Dashboard (track multiple repos)
```
No build process. No dependencies. No `npm install`. **Two HTML files.**

### Option 2: Analyze Local Files
1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Click **📁 Open Folder**
3. Select the folder to analyze
4. Everything processes entirely in your browser

### Option 3: CLI (terminal)
```bash
npm install -g grasp-mcp-server   # Install once
grasp ./my-project                 # Analyse a local folder
grasp facebook/react               # Analyse a GitHub repo
grasp .                            # Analyse current directory
```
Outputs a colour-coded health report and writes `grasp-report.json`.  
Exit code `0` = CI pass, `1` = issues found.

```bash
# One-off with npx
npx --package=grasp-mcp-server grasp .

# Watch mode — browser reloads live on every file save
grasp . --watch

# Time-travel — load last 30 commits as a scrubber
grasp . --timeline

# PR comment output — print markdown report to stdout
grasp . --pr-comment

# Enforce grasp.yml architecture rules — exit 1 on violations
grasp . --check

# Export SARIF for GitHub Code Scanning upload
grasp . --format=sarif
```

### Architecture Rules (`grasp.yml`)

Add a `grasp.yml` file to your repo to enforce architecture standards in CI:

```yaml
rules:
  - min_health_score: 70          # fail if score drops below 70
  - max_blast_radius: 20          # flag any file that affects 20+ others
```

Run locally with `grasp . --check`, or drop the [GitHub Actions template](docs/examples/grasp-check.yml) into `.github/workflows/`.

### Health Badge

Once the GitHub App is installed, embed a live health badge in your README:

```markdown
![Grasp Health](https://grasp.ashforde.org/badge/owner/repo.svg)
```

### @grasp-bot in PRs

Comment `@grasp-bot analyze` on any PR or issue — Grasp will post a full health report inline.

## For LLM Agents & AI Tools — MCP Server

Grasp ships a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** that exposes the full analysis engine as callable tools for Claude Code, Cursor, and any MCP-compatible agent.

```bash
cd mcp && npm install && npm run build
```

Then add to `~/.claude/claude_mcp_settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "grasp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/grasp/mcp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or run without installing:

```bash
npx grasp-mcp-server
```

## Version & Auto-Update

Both `index.html` and `team-dashboard.html` display the current version (`v3.3.11`) in the footer. On load, they silently check the npm registry for a newer `grasp-mcp-server` release. If one is found, a dismissible toast appears:

- **Update Now** — fetches the new HTML from GitHub, downloads it to your machine, and applies it in the current tab immediately
- **Later** — snoozes for 24 hours

No server, no background process. The update check is a single npm registry fetch.

---

## CI/CD Integration

### CLI-based CI Gate

```yaml
- name: Check Grasp health
  run: |
    PASSED=$(cat grasp-report.json | jq '.ci.passed')
    SCORE=$(cat grasp-report.json | jq '.ci.score')
    echo "Health score: $SCORE"
    if [ "$PASSED" != "true" ]; then
      echo "Grasp CI check failed"
      cat grasp-report.json | jq '.ci.failures'
      exit 1
    fi

## Privacy & Security

**Your code stays on your machine.**

**Browser app:**
- Runs 100% in the browser — no server, no proxy
- GitHub API calls go directly from your browser to GitHub
- Your token (if used) lives in `localStorage` only — never sent anywhere except the GitHub API
- No analytics, no tracking, no accounts
- The entire app is [one open-source HTML file](index.html) — audit it yourself

**MCP server:**
- Runs locally as a subprocess — no outbound connections except the GitHub API
- No telemetry, no data collection
- Local directory analysis never leaves your machine — files are read and discarded in memory
